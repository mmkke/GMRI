* Team member roles and responsibilites noted for each milestone

## Check-in

* Shedule a check-in meeting (MM)
* Provide preliminary version of the prototype 
* Demonstrate progress on the project goals
* Walk through the repo, the README.md and any other relevant project files
* Verbal update on stakeholder feedback
* Reproducibility demo (JN)

## Prototype

* URL of a "prototype" branch of the project repo in Canvas (could be main branch).
  * Including (1) technical documentation and (2) a high-level description of results.
* EDA in a separate file called `eda.md` referenced in your README.md
  * Additional EDA in a separate file (final README.md).
* Technical Documentation
  * Entire data-processing pipeline well-documented and easy to reimplement.
  * Instructions clearly informing reproducibility of the reported results.
  * Primary results described briefly for purposes of reproducibility.
  * Technical documentation with sufficient detail to adhere to the "6-month rule".
  * Code follows the DRY principle.
  * Provide appropriate attribution to data sources and anyone who advised the project.
  * The README.md should clearly indicate lessons learned since the initial EDA (documented in eda.md)
    * Did the analytic objectives change based on what you learned from the data or stakeholder?
    * Were data-access or data processing challenges harder than you anticipated?
  * Attribution
    * Acknowledge any influential interactions with others outside your team.
    * Cite any published literature that helped you think about analytic objectives.
* Results
  * There should be a dedicated "docs" folder with a "front-facing" high level description of the project.
    * The audience for the docs folder includes your stakeholder and the general public.
    * It should briefly describe the major findings and put them in context with the original story.
    * It should also describe any challenges encountered along the way.
    * It should include recommenation for next steps if the project were to continue.
  * It can be as simple as a README.md, or a single-page application with interactive visualizations. 
  * Next steps
    * Briefly describe and prioritize some next steps that you would take given sufficient time/resources.
    * Prioritize these somehow. For example: those that should be easy/hard, those that require more data, etc.

## In-class presentations

* Slides presenting results from our repo included in our docs folder.
* Time spent reviewing major results.
* Brief overview of the repo, mentioning reproducibility.
* Clearly describe and distinguish (as appropriate) contributions from individual team members.
* Summarize stakeholder feedback and any impact that it had on the project.

## Final submission

* The final submission should be a revised version of the prototype.
* The revisions should address any feedback from instructor or stakeholder.
* Submit the URL for your final project repo.

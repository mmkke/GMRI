* Story
  * The GMRI Coastal and Marine Economics Lab seeks to understand the mechanisms behind
  decisions and behaviors related to coastal and marine resource uses. This project focuses on the groundfish.
  New England is home to a groundfish fishery that produces a variety of whitefish,
  including species that are culturally important, such as cod and haddock. 
  We also import a large amount of whitefish from the Northeast Atlantic. 
  In other words, locally harvested whitefish directly competes with imports from the Northeast Atlantic. 
  We want to understand the market competition and relationships between New England and Northeast Atlantic 
  (e.g., Norway, Iceland, Scotland).
